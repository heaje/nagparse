nagParse is a parsing class for Nagios configuration files.  The nagParse.php file uses the nagParse class as an example of how to find all the commands in use inside of the Nagios configuration.

While classes do exist for all types of Nagios objects, this code has really only been tested with the following object types:

* command
* contact
* contactgroup
* host
* hostgroup
* service
* timeperiod

Feel free to let me know if any bugs are found!
